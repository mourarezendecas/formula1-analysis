# The Formula 1 analysis repository

## This repository aims to collect and analyze data from Formula 1 races, providing deeper insight into race statistics, results and trends.

## The repository is divided into two main parts:

- The first part is data collection, which uses Web Scraping to obtain data from official Formula 1 websites and store it in a database. This data includes information from past races such as race results, lap times, rankings and driver and team statistics.

- The second part is data analysis, which uses data analysis tools such as Python and R to perform statistical and visual analysis of the collected data. This includes creating graphs and visualizations to represent race trends and results, as well as applying analysis models to predict future race results based on historical data.

## The repository also includes detailed documentation on the data collection and analysis process, as well as a guide to help users understand the collected data and how to use it for their own analyses.

## Contributors are encouraged to contribute new features and functionality, as well as to improve the quality and efficiency of data collection and analysis.
